"If I was blind tasting this dish alone it would be a five star experience no doubt! The chicken is unbelievably silky and the rice has delicious flavor. The hot sauce provided also really enhances the flavor profile and provides some lingering heat to make each bite fun.The reason it is not five stars is because of the little bit of service that was provided was a little rude to be frank. First the lady trying to take orders kept arguing with someone in the back every time she asked what I wanted so it took like 3 tries. Then upon turning over my ticket to get my order fulfilled, I tried to grab a tray and it was unceremoniously slapped down from my hands by the staff again. Ok, sure I guess I didn't really need one but that was also unnecessary to hit it down from me.Can't help but think popularity has gotten to their head a bit. They are the one stall that has a special queue inside Maxwell after all.Still, delicious food and great value. SGD 6 for my medium plate.",4.0,"Nov 14, 2023",2023
"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was on my list of places to eat while in Singapore. It's located in the Maxwell Food Centre and is one of many chicken & rice stands found in Singapore. Not only is it a Michelin Bib Gourmand recognized food stand, it's also a spot where Anthony Bourdain frequented when he visited Singapore. We arrived after the lunch rush were the line was short. My husband grabbed a table while I went to order. I ordered the regular chicken rice for us to share, since I wasn't sure if we wanted to eat more elsewhere or not. They had utensils next to the trays. You queue up, pay in cash when you order, get your ticket, give your ticket to the pick-up window, and go sit down. It's pretty straight forward if you ask me. The chicken is piled on top of the rice and the chili sauce is on the side. When they serve it to you, they pour the brown sauce over the chicken and rice. I kind of wish they had given me more of that chili sauce because it really elevated the dish. The chicken was moist and the rice was flavorful. I was super happy with the dish. There's nothing more comforting than chicken & rice to me. My husband and I gobbled it up and we loved it so much, we went back for a second plate. So, I got back in line and paid for another plate. It was one of my favorite meals in Singapore to date. One thing to note, you need to bring your own napkins or tissues because they don't offer any to customers. Bring your own water bottle or pay for drinks at nearby stands. You and always wash your hands at the nearby restrooms.",5.0,"Oct 6, 2023",2023
"I seriously do not understand why Tian Tian is so overrated despite delivering below-average food and still rated high. Really wonder has anyone really tried a good Chicken rice or just saw the queue and lined up to satisfy the superficial notion.Really such a disappointment seeing such misleading ratings. There are far far better and much tastier options within the Maxwell foodcourt alone for Chicken Rice.My rating out of 5Chicken Quality: 2 / 5Rice Quality: 4 / 5Brown Sauce: 0.5 / 5Chicken Taste: 0.5 / 5Chilli Sauce: 3 / 5Availability of Sides: 1 / 5Service: 4 / 5. the queue moved fastWill I try again: NOWill I recommend anyone: NO, neverP.S: After trying the Tian Tian at Maxwell, all of us in my family had stomach-ache.",1.0,"Jul 15, 2023",2023
"We wanted to try this place as it was always crowded. I arrived at 1:30pm and there was a line up to the back of the food court. The line moved quick and I waited in line for about 10 mins.Steamed chicken rice (Large): the chicken was tender and the flavor was ok. The soy sauce was a delicious compliment to the chicken. The rice was my favorite part: succulent, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The sambal was delicious too. I wish that I could try the roasted version one as it was sold out. It was 3.5 stars for my liking.",4.0,"Jul 5, 2023",2023

"A Michelin Bib Gourmand, Tian Tian specializes in chicken rice and that's what everyone lines up for. If you have no idea where the stall is, just look for the one with the longest line. I mean this line went all the way out of the hawker center! Be smart about it and have just one person order for everyone while the rest look for more food and seating. The chicken itself wasn't that impressive but the rice was so good. There was just so much flavor in every bite. Its doesn't look like much, but it's cheap! I don't think it's worth the wait. You're better off trying other things if the line is crazy long.",4.0,"Feb 7, 2023",2023
"Dropped by Maxwell Center on a Monday at around 7:30 PM and Tian Tian was already closed. Luckily, this hawker center was within walking distance from our hotel, so we tried again on a Wednesday at around 9:30. It was open and there was no line! Jackpot!We ordered the large chicken rice and it was definitely the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. Granted, I've only ever had Hainan chicken rice at restaurants in the states, or making it myself at home (which is a pain to make), but still. The chicken was so tender and flavorful, and the rice was very fragrant. And the chili sauce...the chili sauce was *chef's kiss*. I would be happy just to eat the rice with the chili sauce and some cucumbers. My only regret is not making a return trip to Tian Tian. Totally worth the hype. Just make sure you go early to avoid the lines (which seems like it can get pretty long since they have line posts for crowd control), and in case they sell out quickly.",5.0,"Dec 9, 2022",2022
"I watched so many YouTube videos and made it one of the must stops this time in Singapore. It is located in the Maxwell Food Center - right across the street from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. I came around 11:40 am and the line to order was super long. I was waiting for at least about 35 minutes to 45 minutes until I got to order. My family and I ordered each a medium chicken and rice, a half chicken and a large bokchoy to share. About $60 total.The chicken was so amazing... super tender and juicy. The rice was a little let down from what I expected but still decent. One thing to note - not sure how many stood in line were locals?!? maybe more tourists ?! Since Anthony Bourdain came here before. There are some similar stalls selling the same dishes and the wait is much less.We got our drinks at different stalls in the food center. Bring your own napkins or tissues as they are hard to find.Overall it was a great visit! Definitely recommend if you are willing to wait for a bit!!!",4.0,"Jan 7, 2023",2023
"Yum! We had to stop by Tian Tian Chicken Rice on our recent trip to Singapore. This location is in the Maxwell Food Centre and it's easy to spot this hawker stall as there's always a line outside even when we came pretty early in the day.We only waited about 5 minutes and ended up getting half a chicken with half traditional hainanese chicken and half soy sauce chicken as we wanted to taste the combo and it only comes in a half chicken portion. Was about 16 Singaporean dollars for the meal.The chicken is tender and soft and great with the gravy that they pour on top. The real star of the show was the rice. Super fragrant and packed with a ton of flavor, you can eat the rice by itself and I'd say it's better than the chicken. If I went back I would order less chicken and another bowl rice as one was too little to share with another person.",5.0,"Nov 30, 2022",2022
"I love Hainan chicken but there are so few places to get it back home, so of course we had to try this Michelin Bib Gourmand stall!My favorite part was probably the rice which was super flavorful, but I didn't find the chicken to be anything special. I still think I prefer my favorite shop back home which has a delicious ginger sauce, but Tian Tian gives much larger portions for a fraction of the price.You'll definitely be getting your money's worth by coming here so I think it's still worth stopping by!",4.0,"Jan 23, 2023",2023
"Had to drop by Maxwell to see Tian Tian. Anticipation kept growing as I made my way thru the lunch rush line.Strength in numbers. Have someone scout a table while another waits in line. Got my order quick and easy.A medium order of Hainanese chicken rice will run you $6 SGD, although some may question whether the portion matches its described size.It's all about the rice. Ridiculously flavorful, it definitely outshines the chicken. And because of that... it was underwhelming.If you're from the SGV in SoCal, I would easily pick Tian Tian's rice, but take Cluck2Go's chicken and Savoy's sauces to make a superior dish.",4.0,"Nov 25, 2022",2022
"Located in the Maxwell hawker center, this place is worth trying a plate of their chicken and rice. We knew this was a go-to place when we walked up and there was a line of 6 or 7 people waiting to order in front of this small stall. The Rice is soaked, just INFUSED, with the chicken fat. The fat shines off your lips. Definitely tasting the stock in the rice. Although the chicken wasn't as flavorful as I'd hope, the spicy garlic orange paste makes up in flavor. The sauce here is spicier than the Ah Tai vendor 3 stalls down. I recommend ordering from both stalls and comparing!",5.0,"Sep 2, 2022",2022
Surely representing the best hainanese chicken joint in Singapore as you can see line started at pre-opening.  Chicken is porched and then soaked in cold bath to conceal and retain its juiciness in the chicken which makes the meat silky and moist. Rice is fragrant with a touch of coconut which it's super tasty Absolutely must try,1.0,"Jul 21, 2022",2022

"Came by for a light lunch the other day and it was a sweaty experience! The queue for this Michelin Bib Gourmand stall was ~10-15 minutes at 12:30 pm on a Sunday, except it was 85F outside or 97F after factoring humidity. Luckily Singaporeans queue and there was also a covered waiting area.Prices have gone up drastically due to the chicken shortage from Malaysia.Ordered the chicken thigh rice for $8, cash only. The rice was extremely fragrant, and the chicken was world class juicy. The sauce on top was just world class! The chili dipping sauce was quite spicy too!There are additional tables behind the stalls, except there are no fans!",4.0,"Jul 3, 2022",2022
"Was in Singapore for a few days and knew I had to check this place out. They are closed on Mondays so I came on a Sunday morning. Online said they opened at 1030 but I arrived around 10am and there was already a short line. Waited about 5 minutes - they are quite efficient. Medium sized chicken rice was S$6.00 (small S$5 and large ~S$8). Food was delicious and I loved the spicy sauce it came with as well. Don't think I would wait too long for this place, but glad I was able to try it!They are CASH ONLY.",4.0,"Apr 5, 2019",2019
"SO DELICIOUS SO CHEAP. CASH ONLY! All the hype is right! You'll find this stall in the third(?) row in the food markets. We had read that you would have to wait 40-60 minutes during lunch time. Maybe we got lucky on our vacation, but we only waited 5 minutes on line, and got our food quickly. Obviously get the chicken rice (medium) - there's a star on the menu for most popular plate. The rice is super fragrant and delicious, more moist than I expected. Chicken is delicious as well - you may not even need any sauces. Must come here!! And definitely try other stalls here as well - there's a nice juice and smoothie stall right next to here :)",5.0,"Dec 30, 2017",2017
"Food is very good, cheap and comes out quickly. You can get the chicken with rice, as a set with soup and vegetables, or a full chicken. The man running the stall is efficient and has a sense of humor. You can also get delivery with Grab. Keep in mind that some items sell out, such as the set. Highly recommended for a fast casual meal!",4.0,"Sep 26, 2013",2013

"100% behind the hype on this place. It was on Anthony Bourdains ""No Reservation"" and has a Michelin star & it's star dish - chicken rice ... comes in at a whopping total of $6 (Singapore dollars ... so even cheaper for USA). 3 different sizes depending on your hunger level, and I opted for the medium... however, I wish I got the large because it was just that good!The rice was ok, nothing spectacular, the sauce on top is what makes the flavor pop there but the chicken.. just wow. It is SO SO SO juicy and tender. I am literally googling how to cook any kind of chicken dinner in my future just like that. I dare say the best chicken I've had.

"Way overrated. Canteen quality food, rice doesn't taste like it's cooked with chicken oil but doused with soy sauce, chicken has little flavor and rather stiff. Doesn't even put garnishing to even attempt to make the food look the least bit appetizing.",1.0,"Jul 2, 2023",2023
"Everyone talks about this place so I wanted to try it. The Hainanese Chicken Rice was ok for me. I can't say that I'd go back here for this. Maybe the rice and the sauce were the best part. I did finish my dish tho. It wasn't bad or good. The price was outrageous for the half chicken rice. It was $16! I saw Anthony Bourdain's picture on the window. Yeah, that's why it was so expensive for what it is. I'd go to any other places in the Hawkers and pay $6 for the dish. I bet it would taste the same.",4.0,"Jul 3, 2022",2022
"I wonder why this chicken rice stall is so famous? Because Anthony Bourdain featured it? Dishes are expensive comparing to the ambiance. No ac, humid, noisy, too much foot traffic... don't waste your time here. The quality of the chicken is not there. I've eaten at less known stalls and they taste way much better. Aragon & rude wait staff. And you have to take your own dishes as it's a self service place. Pay so much and serve yourself. No meaning... The chicken meat sucks. More bones than meat!

"If you want flavorful and fragrant chicken rice, tender and delicious chicken, and overall a super delicious rice plate for an incredible price....this is it. My friend and I were crazy to think that we'd only share one medium plate. We ended up ordering seconds. The rice with the chicken and the sauce (amazing) over the entire dish was literally *chef's kiss* I don't know how else to explain it. And it's super affordable. You can't get a dish like this for ~$3.50 USD back in the States....Don't be scared by the line because it goes by pretty quickly. We went around the time they opened to avoid the line (which we did!!), but since we ordered seconds, we had to wait in line that time- but it did not take long! Definitely avoid lunch hour to be safe because the hawker stalls get CROWDED and you might not be able to score a seat!",4.0,"Apr 4, 2021",2021
"What else hasn't been said about the super popular Tian Tian chicken and rice stall? I'm not sure if I can add anything else. Yes, Bourdain was here. As usual, he is right. This quintessential Singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you can't find fault in it. Incredibly soft chicken, fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree. I ordered a large portion (S$8.80 for a large though?!) so I could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein. There wasn't a wait when I came in at 11am. The crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out. I'm not one to stand in line for a long time and there are other chicken and rice stalls at Maxwell's which are probably worth a try too.",5.0,"Feb 27, 2023",2023

"Tian Tian does not make the same Hainanese chicken rice dish that your mom used to make (sorry Mom, it's true)!  Actually, I cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish... but if she had, then it still would not have compared.  Tian Tian's chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become!There are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish, so I will provide you with a pro tip - the line here can get long quickly, so plan to stop in at an off-time (ya know, not during the typical lunch/dinner rush times).  I stopped in early on a Friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered - score!  Shortly after I sat down to wait the brief wait for my order, the line grew ten-plus long in a snap.Tian Tian is definitely a must-try in Singapore!*****FIVE STARS*****",4.0,"Apr 25, 2020",2020
"During my recent trip to Singapore, I went on a mission to find the best chicken rice. Tian Tian, recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, was the first stop on my quest.Tian Tian is located at the Maxwell Food Centre, a short walk from Marina Bay. Don't be alarmed at the long line. It moves quickly!We ordered a medium chicken rice to share (but came back again the next day and ordered our own), which set us back 5 Singapore dollars ($3.69 USD). A total steal for lunch.What makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well:- the chicken is perfectly poached, soft & juicy- the rice is fragrant and tasty, not bland like at Hawker Chan- the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty, there's chili, citrus (probably lime), a little bit of oil, a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish. I need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because I want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals.If you are in Singapore, you MUST visit Tian Tian.",5.0,"Feb 29, 2020",2020
"I came here on my first day in Singapore and managed to skip any lines as it was about 10:45am. Score for no lines at a Michelin rated hawker stall!Went ahead and ordered their specialty Hainam chicken dish. I thought it was good and what snt it apart, was the gravy sauce! You can't find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the 1 Michelin Star rating.After much thought, I think America has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here I in Singapore. I would defInitely recommend coming here to try the sauces Hainan Chicken if there's no ginormous line!",1.0,"Dec 1, 2022",2022
"I think my problem going into this experience were my expectations being extremely high. I've heard tons fo good feedback about Tian Tian's chicken and rice. Don't kill me for saying it, but it was so-so.. and I think that's because I sous-vide my chicken at home so I'm spoiled with super tender/moist poultry. That said I totally get for people who don't sous vide regularly, how this would be a mind blowing experience. Super affordable, great with a Tiger beer; but didn't finish the plate thinking I needed to come back again.",4.0,"Jan 11, 2020",2020
"Born out of frugality and created by servant-class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken, chicken rice dishes are a staple to Singaporean cuisine. I did the chicken rice challenge between Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based. If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price. Although it did not fill me up, it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day.",4.0,"Jan 13, 2020",2020

"This place deserves a 6-star rating. Where have you been all my life!? I ate it once and had to keep going back. I woke up dreaming of it for breakfast, wished it was lunch, and possibly fast forward to dinner for this Hainanese Chicken Rice. I love the unpretentious hawker vibe, and then this amazing National dish, a dish a song should be written about -- chicken is super smooth, tender, flavorful.

"Rated to be one of the top places to get Chicken rice in Singapore so I had to try it. This joint has 2 locations but I wanted to try the popular one that is located in the Maxwell food center.Located on the opposite side of Maxwell ave of the hawker center, you will put your order in and grab a ticket. You'll then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food. The line can queue up depending on the time, especially during the lunch hour. However I showed up a little before 11:30 on a Tuesday and there was no wait!Most popular is the medium chicken rice, which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate. Chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good. I highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in Singapore",4.0,"Aug 7, 2022",2022
"Got there 15 min before it closes. The line was not bad for Saturd night & they cranked out the orders very quickly. This place def knows how to handle the long queue which its fame has brought.  We ordered 2 medium chicken rice $5 each) & 1 side of vege in oyster sauce $6).  The chicken was solid, relatvely tender & not too dry, skins & bone attached. Most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts.  When served it already has a layer of light sauce on it, but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce. Again I wish they have that Cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger & slightly saltier.  The rice was also good, cooked in the chicken's own juice.  The vege was pretty good as well, lightly flavored & still relatively crunchyOverall the place serves solid food, but I could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places.",4.0,"Feb 2, 2020",2020

"I was building this up in my head so much, that I was sure I was going to disappointed. Such a cheap Michelin star restaurant - there's gotta be a catch right?Not with Tian Tian.We had to wait in line for about 10 mins. Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go. But don't wait in line too long though.

We got here around 9AM but it didn't open until 10AM on the dot. A lot of stalls weren't open yet so we just got a drink and waited. Line started forming close to 10AM and the line got long reallly quick. The first orders took awhile and we were prob 3rd or 4th in line. Order the large chicken rice to share with 2 for 7.80. Chicken was very juicy, soft and tender! Rice was good and goes well. Dip it in the sauce that they give you.

"I'm not going to deny that this is good chicken rice, but I could never justify waiting any more than 20 minutes to have it. Luckily there was no wait when we went a few weeks before CB. Due to its popularity, they have a very streamlined ordering process and we got our chicken rice in no time. The rice is very fragrant and the chicken wasn't that juicy or flavorful.

"Yes, Tian Tian is definitely a tourist destination in the Maxwell Food Center. Popular tourist destinations tend to be known for being overrated, but I thought that Tian Tian served a decent chicken rice dish. You'll notice that there is always a long line for this stall, but the line moves pretty quickly.I ordered a large roasted chicken with rice. The portion sizes here are on the smaller size, so my ""large"" order was much smaller than I expected. The roasted chicken was nicely cooked, but the rice was what stole the show for me. The rice had a very strong chicken aroma and flavor that made it quite delicious. The red chili sauce that came on the side added a rather strong spicy kick to each bite (it was spicier than I expected).I enjoyed the chicken rice that I got here. While the portions here were small, the chicken was flavorful and the rice was even more delicious. All of this for such a cheap price? Tian Tian has my vote.",4.0,"Sep 29, 2019",2019
"Underwhelming. I think that's the perfect word to describe my experience eating the infamous Anthony Bourdain/Michelin Star rated Hainan Chicken.The chicken was cold when we started eating, and the only sauce that came with it is the red sauce, which is quite spicy so be cautious when drenching the chicken for the first time. I also feel like I didn't get a lot of meat for what we paid for. It was mainly just bone ... Another disappointment. The rice was good but I just feel like I expected so much more and that's not what I got. I've definitely tried better Hainan Chicken back home. Maybe I just had too many expectations but I don't think I'll be back, nor would I recommend this to visiting friends and family. I'm sure there's better places out there.",5.0,"Dec 30, 2018",2018
"Maybe my taste bud for Hainanese chicken is much more Americanized? I hated Tian Tian's slimey, gelatiny texture. The chicken was really wet but not moist. It had been drown in some kind of soy, oil mixture for way too long. Everything was in a half melted jello consistency. The rice was fine but nothing to write home about. Really turned off by mouthful of gelatinized fat but was later told that part  holds the key to every great hainanese chicken rice. Unfortunately, not for me, C plus at best in my book.",4.0,"Jul 19, 2020",2020

"There are 2 famous chicken rice places at Maxwell, and they're only a few stalls down from each other. Tian tian was the original and occupies stalls 10-11.The rice plate comes in small, medium, large. The small is only 3.50 - it's nice to have the option of small so you  can try more stuff. They also have other dishes, but the rice plate is the star. Order at line A and pickup at line B. The chicken rice is chicken breast (boneless and skinless), which I appreciate. It's super tender. The rice also has good chicken flavor. Warning: the hot sauce sauce is hot.",4.0,"Jul 30, 2018",2018
"Delish Hainanese chicken! First time I attempted to try out this place was on a Thursday at around 5:30 pm, about 6 or 7 people ahead of me by the time they  completely sold out - sad. Ended up going to Ah Tai (which was delish!).Tried again on a Friday around 11:45 am. The line was super long, but it moved quickly. We got a medium sized portion for $5 SGD. The rice was delish and the chicken was tender. The spicy sauce was really spicy and so good! I will say that after trying Ah Tai, I felt like Ah Tai was a better value and just as delish. If you're not feeling the wait for tian tian, def try out Ah Tai. Otherwise, tian tian is worth a try!",4.0,"Apr 16, 2018",2018
"I can understand why this place is so popular (we showed up around 11 and there already was a line). The chicken was very tender and moist, though I'm confused by why there was no skin included. Rice was also well flavored, if a bit too soft for my taste. No aircon in the hawker center, so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you're good to go.",5.0,"Jan 11, 2018",2018
"Another Michelin-rated hawker meal.  Another lineup and another great meal for only $5SG.  The chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good.

"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food Center is one of Singapore's busiest food stalls with such fans as Gordon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain. But what is Hainanese chicken rice? In short -- it's seasoned poached chicken with rice, served with chilli sauce and garnished with cucumber. It was created by immigrants from Hainan province in southern China as a cheap and easy meal.We hit up the Maxwell Food Center as part of a tour with Sneak Peek Singapore. This stall wasn't part of our tour (that sampled foods from other stalls with no wait). So I recommend tag teaming with someone. The line moves quickly, but anticipate a wait of 20-30 minutes. We BARELY got our chicken in time before our tour nearly left us behind. The stall sells other dishes like vegetables with oyster sauce and cuttlefish. But you basically come here for one dish only -- the famed Hainanese chicken rice. I recommend ordering the most popular option -- a medium-sized chicken rice priced at $5 Singaporean dollars (or about $3.60 USD).What's the verdict? Was the wait worth it? I think so. The rice was perfectly cooked. Though, the chicken tasted pretty similar to other places we tried.  If you have the time to wait (and patience), add it to your foodie check list. Or if you hate waiting like me, tag team with another person to wait in line.",4.0,"Apr 6, 2018",2018
"Okay, so its been 9 years since i have been here (yelp was not in singapore yet) but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever! Braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the Maxwell food market! Their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry.  Texture is spot on. Gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious.  I miss this place still",4.0,"Dec 11, 2019",2019
"maybe more like 3.75 out of 4 stars.if you're in Singapore, you will most likely check out a few hawkers. we actually checked out this Maxwell Food Centre hawker twice in a time span of 24 hours.... lol, once at night when pretty much everything was closed, and once again in the morning to get here before the crowd of people line up at tian tian.  this place attracts famous chefs and other famous tv personal (RIP anthony bourdain), so i had to check this place out.  i'm giving it 4 stars, since i did not have to wait that long. i got here around 9:30 and there were a few other people here as well, but when we started lining up, i didn't need to wait more than 5 mins to get the food.  and getting the food is very quick.we got a medium sized hainan chicken rice, bean sprouts and some chicken gizzards. the chicken rice is like as everyone else will say, bomb.  however, there is a duck restaurant that's adjacent to this place, and that even better rice.  if you can combine that rice with this hainan chicken, it would be the perfect meal. everything was cheap, and filling!believe this place is cash only.",4.0,"Jan 15, 2020",2020
"Heard that this was one of the most famous chicken rice hawkers in Singapore, but I was quite disappointed.

"Anointed by the Travel Channel giants as THE best chicken rice in Singapore.  Recognized by the Michelin Guide as a bib gourmand eatery.  All that translates into long lines, sterile service,  and a mass produced product that, while good, doesn't live up to the hype.1. Stand in the long line that disappears around the corner.  2. Place your entire order at the first window.  A modern POS spits out a payment receipt and an order tag.3. Grab a tray and spoons.4. Hand your order tag (not your payment receipt) to the person at the second window where already assembled plates of chicken rice and hot sauce sit.5. The number and type of plate will be placed on the tray.6. Done.The chicken (ordered large drum that includes thigh meat), tender, juicy and impregnated with a lemon grass, kefir lime leaf flavor.  The rice, clearly cooked in the chicken stock but flavor not as deep as expected.  Adding the more herbaceous chili sauce adds a good clean chili flavor that does elevate the dish.Note:  no bowl of cooking broth as given by most otther stalls.A bargain at $3.50 SGD regular, $3.75 SGD large.  Choice of breast or drum / theigh meat, half or whole chicken.  Side plate of veg also available.Outstanding for sure, just not the best.",4.0,"Feb 10, 2020",2020

"One of the most delicious finds during my last trip to Singapore!Hainanese chicken rice can be found on every corner in Singapore but Tian Tian definitely warrant a visit! Nestled in Chinatown's iconic Maxwell Hawker Center, this particular stall is easy to spot thanks to the long lines as well as a big poster of Anthony Bordain next to it. Their menu is pretty straightforward and all the usual suspects are available - steamed/roasted chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce. For my first visit, I can't decide between the poached or the roasted chicken, so when in doubt, the rule of thumb is to get both! :P. The chicken was tender and juicy while the rice was flavorful with a mouthwatering aroma! Altogether there was a good harmony between the chicken, rice, chili sauce and soy sauce. I honestly love both versions, but the later added a nice smoky flavor that I like.The pricing was dead cheap with each plate costing around $4-8 SGD (depending on the portions) and food was served canteen style. Simple, affordable and utterly delicious.... Can't help but to fall in love with Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice!",4.0,"Mar 21, 2017",2017
"We were in full-on tourist mode and decided to try our luck at the super popular Tian Tian stall. It opens at 10am and a line begins to form even before opening time. We were in line by 10:15am and I was concerned about the wait time. The online reported wait times turned out to be quite exaggerated based on our experience. It took us about 15 minutes to get served, and that is only because they were running behind and hadn't opened on time, meanwhile a crowd was building. If we had arrived at 10:45am, the wait would've been at most 5 minutes.With the volume of business that Tian Tian does, they've perfected the service. You decide what size you want and pay at the first section, then walk over to the second section and pick up your plate of food. Finally, find any seat at the hawker centre and enjoy your meal. It's very simple and efficient.I have to say that I enjoyed the chicken very much. However, is it better than other chicken rice in Singapore? I think not.",5.0,"Nov 24, 2017",2017
"There's chicken rice and then there's Tian Tian's chicken rice. This is hands down the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. The rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist. It pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick.The store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line. We got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at 11.30am or so and ended up waiting 10 minutes. It's a well oiled machine but I'd expect a wait of around 15 to 20 minutes during peak times. On the bright side, you can easily spot the store by the long line!",1.0,"Mar 21, 2017",2017
There was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up. It moved pretty quickly though. I think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy. I ordered the thigh and greens on the side. The hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat. The chicken was top notch. Flavorful and super juicy and soft. The pepper was great...I asked for 2. Lol! I went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left. They discounted to $5 each. I took 2. Even the breast was super moist. I wish I could eat this every day!,4.0,"Jan 25, 2019",2019
Definitely not as flavorful as advertised by many however is definitely good Hainan Chicken. The gravy now is just...well gravy it adds nothing and takes away nothing and is just kind of there. The rice IS still very flavorful and the chicken is definitely very tender however the subtle aromas you get from really really good Hainan Chicken is just not there unfortunately. Definitely still a great bang for your buck but if the line is too intense I would try another stand! Lots of other delicious options to choose from.,4.0,"May 4, 2019",2019
"Tian Tian can be found right in the center of hawker center, where you see the huge line outside. This place is extremely hyped through media and is being recommended on all travel guides and hotels. Flavor 3.5/5The chicken is very standard. What's special is the rice which was very flavorful as they have adjusted their recipe multiple times per what I've read online. Wait and line 1/5The wait is 30+ minutes at 12pm on Saturday. The wait at Ah tai is much shorter and the taste is very similar as it was opened by someone who used to work at tian tian. Ah tai has a better yelp rating and a better price to value ratio.Price 4/5Generally hawker center is cheap. Compared to other hainan chicken places there tian tian is considered slightly more expensive. At ah tai you pay $5 for a set (chicken, rice, soup and veggie) which is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure Comparison to Ah tai: Tian tian's rice tastes better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening. However the price is slightly more expensive with $9 if you want the veggies and chicken. The portions are slightly smaller and you wait faaar longer. Overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken. If you do have time and what to taste the best one. Take a shot and wait in line",4.0,"Dec 19, 2019",2019
"The Tian Tian hawker stall is one of my top recommendations to all my friends who visit SG. They've received the Michelin ""Bib Gourmand"" recommendation, which is right below their star system. Also I've seen Anthony Bourdain's raving review for this place as well. The menu is really simple, the individual orders: Small, Medium, Large  or you can buy half or full chicken. What makes the chicken special is how overly tender (good way) the cuts of chicken are.  Typically I order to medium individual sized portion and bean sprouts. Total 7 bucks.",5.0,"Sep 28, 2019",2019
"THIS PLACE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!! Best chicken and rice I have had in Singapore and let me tell you I ate chicken and rice for 3 days straight at different places but nothing compares. Meat is juicy, soy sauce is sweet/ salty, rice is perfectly flavored, and the chili sauce is spicy  my friend and I came before the lunch rush so there was only a 10 min wait but when we left it was outside the stand.  Only downside would be that in comparison to other places they don't give you as much food for the same price ($4.50 SGD). I know other places I went to it was the same price but it was included with soup and veggies as well. This place just serves chicken rice and cucumbers. Nice and simple but I would have liked some soup on the side for a complete meal. Definitely worth the wait and the hype! Give it a try if you are ever in Singapore",4.0,"Dec 3, 2018",2018

"The chicken here is sooo tender and at the same time it's flavourful. The rice that comes with is chicken oil rice, and just like what Antony Bourdain says: it's so good you can eat it itself. We enjoyed this place so much that we came back for a second meal the same day and totally don't regret doing it. The chili lime sauce that comes as a dip, taste delicious too, but beware it can be a bit spicy. It gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist. It almost taste like a Thai lime sauce. The boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce, which just makes everything taste better. The squid with bean sprouts came with a Thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all. I suggest adding a bit of the chicken dip sauce if you would like a kick.",4.0,"May 13, 2019",2019

After trying the chicken rice at Ah Tai I heard there's a battle between that place and Tian Tian for the title of best chicken rice in Singapore.  I'll stay away from that debate so I don't get banned from the country due to whoever might be working the customs counter that day :)I'll say that this place also had really damn good chicken rice!

"Okay, do bear in mind I have been to Singapore 8 or so times in the last 3 years.. Still have not made to this place until recently. I had one day that I was in Singapore before the work week started and I had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook. Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line). The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish. I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall.",5.0,"Jun 4, 2019",2019

Go light if you can't handle spicy. They will provide two sauce. Get the rice, it really is delicious, there is a light ginger and coconut taste to it.This is located at the Hawker Centre (Center). There are many different stalls. Explore, try a bit of everything. The drinks are cheap, average $1.50-2 USD.You have to find your own seats and I'd say have one person buy and one hold the seats.

Though, I have to say there were about 20 people ahead of me in the queue and majority of them where Singaporeans, so it can't be that bad, right? It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice. Under was a layer of cucumbers, which to me was pointless.The highlight was the rice! Superbly fragrant, a little oily and I could taste the ginger and garlic.Chicken rice is Singapore's national dish, so it's worth trying at least once even if it's not Tian Tian's version!",4.0,"Aug 8, 2019",2019
"10am on a Sunday morning, I was at the Maxwell Food Centre in Singapore. We decided to go for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant, simply because of the many positive Yelp reviews and also the fact that the place was featured by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant opens at 10am and already there is a very long lineup.  Other places serves similar menu and gets only customers who have no patience for waiting in line.   Service was very fast, but do not expect too much, except having a chance to taste this famous dish as this a food court and tables are not necessarily spotlessly clean. I ordered 2 Hainanese Chicken Rice.   The cashier pointed to 2 vegetable dishes displayed as pictures on the board, cuttlefish sprout and bokchoy vegetables.  I ordered one of each, thinking that these came complementary as part of the menu I ordered. Had I known, I would have skipped the vegetables.   15 minutes later, I was walking away with my order. Bill comes to $18, being $5 for Hainanese Chicken and $4 for the vegetables. The chicken is very tender, so tender that it just melts in your mouth.  There are no bones and practically no fat.  But, frankly, I am more used to have chicken which has a bit of a bite.   There is a sauce that you get on the side that would spice the food up, but I find the meat to be quite bland without.  Very affordable, and worth a try.",5.0,"Nov 28, 2018",2018

Of course we wanted to come here, since we all saw this episode on Anthony Bourdain's show! My fiance and I ordered one medium to share, since we wanted to try other Hawker stalls too. We honestly had the same underwhelmed reaction. Yes, the chicken was okay, but it was served cold, which I'm guessing is how it's supposed to be prepared. I guess I've been eating Hainanese chicken wrong my whole life (warm). The rice was DAMN GOOD though, with all the chicken fat drippings saturating the warm carb. I mean, yeah, it was good for a few dollars, but not something I'd go back for. I'd rather try other Hainanese chicken places, without lines, and just as good ratings.

"This was a must visit destination on our Singapore itinerary, Michelin starred Hainanese Chicken Rice. I have watched every YouTube video on this dish. The likes of Anthony Bourdain and Mike Chen (YouTuber) have raved about it. Having eaten over a hundred Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes I was about to eat the world's best. Located in a hawker like setting, be prepared to sweat bullets. We decided to go at night. Once inside this area, with stall after stall of open kitchen, you will feel the heat. It's hotter than outside. The line is long but it moves fast. Not going to lie, I am not used to these conditions. As my son and I grab a table with strangers, we wait with the large fans above blowing at us with no relief. As the dishes are placed in front of me, I can tell how juicy and succulent the dark meat looks. What I didn't quite expect was the strange gelatinous coating all over the chicken. I'm not sure what that is but I dig in. It is beyond tender and the skin on the chicken was very silky. Again, I was a bit bothered by that gelatinous coating. As I take each bite, it was hard to eat as the large fans kept blowing my hair and getting stuck against my sweaty face. I had to make sure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken at the same time. Unfortunately, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this before. It's still good but nothing special. All in all we did enjoyed the meal. The method where they quickly poach their chicken works. Had I have eaten it in a much cooler environment, I might have enjoyed my meal better. There are no napkins as Singapore has a go-green policy. You can wash your hands at a sink as you exit out.",1.0,"May 21, 2016",2016

"Mmmm chicken rice! Since my visit at Tian Tian, nothing has really compared to give there chicken rice real competition. Located in the Maxwell Food Centre hawkers is where I found Tian Tian. I knew to come here because I researched beforehand best chicken rice in Singapore. Tian Tian got voted such by local foodies and celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain. If that wasn't reason enough, a helpful hint I always go by is that you always eat where the locals flock to. There's a good reason for that line you're about to stand in. Service didn't take long at all, and this line was only 3 people deep. You get served on the spot, we ordered two servings of chicken rice. That's the reason we came here. The rice was fragrant, with chicken was so tender and smooth. The skin didn't bother me, it was thin and not chewy like eating a fatty piece on meat. The broth complimented it all with chili and soy sauce; it was perfect.",4.0,"Jan 9, 2020",2020
"I know a 5-star rating is potentially controversial for Tian Tian which has been a victim of its own success.  Before all the hullabaloo, before No Reservations, it was just a solid choice for chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre.  And you know what? It continues to be a solid choice, delivering a solid consistently good, wholesome, flavorful, and traditionally authentic product.  So take away everything that's been written or said about Tian Tian in recent history and it'll stand on its own as a solid choice for chicken rice if you're in the neighborhood.  Is there a better chicken rice out there? Almost certainly, but that misses the entire point of a chicken rice stall in a food centre in Singapore.  At the end of the day, it's all about accessibility.  That these hawker centres were purpose-built to make affordable nutrition accessible.  That hawkers, over the years,  have devoted time and passion into making their offerings actually good is a wondrous unintended consequence of this most Singaporean of experiments.  So yes, Tian Tian is still good, pandemic or no, and hopefully will continue to be a solid go to option when wandering around Maxwell.  Do I think it's the best chicken rice in Singapore...for that answer you'll have to get to know me much better first.",4.0,"Jul 9, 2019",2019
"Truth be told...I never tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice before and wasn't sure what the hype was about other than the famous Anthony Bourdain visiting this stall. Came here with a couple of friends and we went super early before opening time to avoid the long lines.Place opened roughly around 10am, but do be prepared to wait in a line since this place is pretty popular among the locals and tourists. Wait time for the food wasn't too long and the portion amount was decent.Overall, the chicken rice wasn't mind blowing, but rather, it was a tasty dish. The rice was quite flavorful and fragrant and the chicken was soft and tender. I definitely like the house made chili that definitely had a lot of zing and spicy to it.Still haven't figured out why there is such a craze for this dish but it's worth the try if you like chicken rice. Also, I noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to Tian Tian, so do check the names before waiting in line if you're looking for the ""famous"" chicken rice place (aka Tian Tian). Another recommendation I have is if you're in a group, have one person make the order for everyone. Saves time and it does make the line shorter ;)",5.0,"Apr 24, 2019",2019

If you're from Los Angeles, you're probably familiar with Savoy's Hainan chicken, which locals always rave about.

"Famous chicken rice stall in SG's Maxwell hawker center. The rice is very fragrant - strong chicken stock smell. The chicken is juicy and tender which makes a good combo to the rice. The drawback is the dish was just too oily for my taste and the chicken has a bit too much red meat (I personally prefer white meat chicken for chicken rice). The accompanying chili sauce helps give a bit of contrast to the oiliness but nonetheless not the best chicken rice in SG for me. We also tried the stall next to it (which is a spin-off from the original restaurant) - while the taste overall is similar, I do find Tian Tian's rice a little bit more fragrant.

The chicken was cold, very smooth and velvety, if that makes sense.  I actually liked the sauce, but thought that there was too much of it and would have been very content with just the ginger chili sauce which was the best I have had in Sing.  They poured a lot of the soy-based sauce on my dish and I ended up tasting that more than the chicken.  Rice was good, but not as memorable for me. Like most, I wanted to complain about the rice and the vegetables costing extra.  And I miss my clear broth soup.  It helps wash everything down.

Go at an off peak hour to avoid the lines and the wait shouldn't be more than 5 minutes. We ordered a whole chicken, a vegetable with oyster sauce, and three rice for the three of us and were able to finish everything. Unlike other places that just serves their chicken plain, at Tian Tian they dress up their chicken with an awesome sauce that makes it taste velvety smooth. They also don't offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those aren't really necessary. The rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor, and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat. The vegetable with oyster sauce is just your typical baby bok choy blanched in water so nothing to rave about, but we always order some veggies with every meal.Definitely stop by here to try Singapore's national dish and eat like a local.",4.0,"Aug 18, 2018",2018

This hawker stall is located inside Maxwell Food Center and can be easily spotted by the epic-sized line formed down from their stall. The line does move fairly quickly and our wait was about 20 minutes in total.We got the larger plate just because we waited so long. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the dish. It didn't even make it to the top 10 best Hainan Chicken Rice I've had. First off, the chicken was ice cold. I understand that some place don't serve their chicken hot but having chicken that basically just came out of the fridge is quite unappetizing. The chicken was also not trimmed off fat and the meat was tough.The rice and sauce was decent but average at best. They were definitely not enough to redeem the dish from the tough cold chicken meat. I would definitely recommend skipping this place.",4.0,"Apr 27, 2018",2018

Still if you're in Maxwell Road market during off peak hours, it's worth trying Tian Tian if the line isn't long. I jumped into the line when I noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around 3pm. That's when I noticed they had receipts with them. I obviously missed something. It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly. The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce.

The chicken and rice dish definitely hit the spot. The skin was full of oil that was naturally coming out from the chicken and melts right in your mouth. As well, the chicken meat was super tender and juicy. It is always a pleasure eating chicken in Asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in America.

While the rice is definitely soft and fragrant, the chicken was flavorless... and cold. I've never received chicken and rice in Singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of Tian Tian, but aside from just being tender, there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something I'd come out of the way for. The second time I came here was out of my boyfriend's interest to try and had the exact same experience. Personally, definitely not worth the wait in the queue (although give it a try if you're lucky enough to not have to wait).

It's not bogged down by a lot of flavors attacking your mouth from all directions--its just a simple, clean, and honest serving of chicken atop a bed of faintly flavored rice.

"I am not very often angry when receiving bad food. Disappointed, yes. Upset, maybe but never angry.While I know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer's tastebuds, I never really thought that I would get so angry over a stall that doesn't deserve its award..... until today. For years I've been wanting to give Tian Tian Chicken Rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue. Than came Singapore's edition of the Michelin Guide and with a Bib Gourmand recommendation, the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today....I can't help but think WHY? Tian Tian chicken rice lacks just about everything I would consider as a good chicken rice. The Rice.While the texture of the rice was fine, it was neither fragrant or tasty. It lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have. It didn't have that pungent garlic or ginger taste, or the umami-ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice. While the colour looked on point, the flavours were severely lacking. The ChickenSeeing that it was our first time trying, we ordered a portion of white (boiled) chicken and a portion of the roasted. Portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy. The white chicken didn't have the smooth, moist , juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous. Instead, it was overcooked and stringy.The roast chicken didn't fair any better. Overcooked, stringy and the skin didn't offer any flavours to the protein. The only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken, which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish. To the tourists that have tried it because of the Bib Gourmand, my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in Singapore and for those you are thinking about trying, please don't, there are better options out there. Michelin recommended? Better to rip that page out of the book.",5.0,"Nov 27, 2018",2018

The chicken is almost like a sou vide preparation where it is barely cooked with a savory sauce poured on top of it and the rice.It wasn't my favorite dish, but it was tasty.

This was also my first time trying Hainanese Chicken rice. I was impressed to say the least. Lemme just say, this place is hyped up but it's for a reason. This is a ~no-frills, order at the counter, sit down in the Singapore humidity~ and eat type of establishment. When we approached the stall, there was already a small line formed. First, you pay for your order then you wait as it's assembled.  I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving my food. I ordered a medium sized chicken rice, with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce. It.Was.INCREDIBLE. The chicken was perfect. I'm a big fan of big flavor, and I was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good. I mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven. The rice was fluffy and in the words of Anthony Bourdain ""absolutely fragrant."" and the cucumbers added perfect, refreshing crunch. I was STARVING on this day, and I just had to go back for seconds. I ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time, the cooks at the counter chuckled and said ""back for more?"" I said ""Its so good, can't stay away."" They had a hoot and I left absolutely satisfied.** As a tip; the small and medium sized are pretty much exactly the same.

"I was told Tian Tian has the best hainan chicken in Singapore. That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?) I decided to go again the next day.Well, first things first, the price was unbeatable. Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant.

"When we showed up to the Maxwell Centre yesterday afternoon, we saw a long line and worried that it might be for Tian Tian...and we were right. That said, the line itself, while looking a bit daunting, moves along relatively quickly - after all, how long can it take to serve a bunch of chicken rice? We ended up getting to the front of the line in about 20 minutes' time - not too bad - and we were served shortly thereafter. Unless you are really full already, I would go with a large, which, in all honesty, is not that large to begin with. Once we found ourselves a table, we chowed into the famous chicken rice - and in all honesty, it is pretty good, but it was not quite as 'amazing' as waiting in line might make you expect. The chicken is flavored well, although the sauce is a bit on the light side. I really do enjoy the cilantro here, but the quantity of leaves is pretty small. Speaking of quantity - the amount of chicken is also a bit less than I would expect, and with the pieces served with bones in them, you do have to work your way around it to get the meat off - no small feat when you have no napkins and no knives to help with. The rice is really well-flavored on its own - I could probably just eat that as a standalone - and the combination of the marinated chicken with the rice makes it easy to understand why it's so popular.So why the average rating? As I mentioned, the quantity of food was a bit low. For S$7.80, it's not a bad deal...but consider when we decided to give Tong Fong Fatt (a few stalls down a whirl)...it's no contest - their chicken is better, you get more of it (as well as soup), it is cheaper to boot, and perhaps best - there's no line.

"Dear Anthony Bourdain,With ""no reservations"", I'm writing due to my fair lady, who has been one of your many fans for the longest time, for your video highlighting the chicken rice experience in Singapore. Before her visit to Singapore, she sent me a link to your video (I'm sorry I've never cared enough to watch any of your shows even though I'm practically always on Food Network) and MADE me watch it so that I could bring her there.Well, that's the thing...that video and your stupid picture on the stall makes people think that the stall is freaking good because you ""approved"" it.Oh, please.It is quite obvious in the video that you would have never tried chicken rice if the crowd didn't BOO the living crap out of you (which I've done since I first watched one of your shows).So I must say - as I did to my fair lady - that I knew of Tian Tian way before you even highlighted it in your story. Singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or ""approval"" to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall.For example, I just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be GREAT. Just like on the day that I binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version...I tried the porridge with a line that took nearly 40 minutes before I got to order...that DIDN'T have your face on their stall.For the record, do us all non-fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans (such as my fair lady) that your ""approval"" of this stall is worthless because your opinion on Asian food (or all other local food) just doesn't count. Not to mention, if the crowd didn't boo you, I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have tried chicken rice.You fail.Tian Tian just WINS enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it.Get a real chef job.Sincerely,ChickenRice-FanYelp 100: 24/100",4.0,"Sep 24, 2016",2016

I'm pretty sure that when we arrived at 1pm, we had at least 30 people in front of us. However, I must give them props for efficiency, it was far quicker than expected.We ordered Hainanese chicken rice, Beansprouts (taugeh) and Vegetables with oyster sauce. I think the reason why it is so famous is their absurdly fragrant rice! The sauce on the hainanese chicken is really good too! On top of that, the hainanese chili sauce is really very good!If you have time, want a decent hainanese chicken rice, come here.

"I didn't think the menu would be that complicated so I said uhhhh 1 order please? (expecting a little help). Somehow I ended up with skinless chicken breast.

They're probably resting on their laurels at this point, although I'm not sure if it was ever deserved, just press from Bourdain....Tong Fong Fatt in this same Maxwell Food center was better, at least it came with soy and chili sauce.

"Drop by Maxwell market on a Saturday afternoon and saw the stall has almost no queue. Told the cashier that I wanted a plate of chicken rice and was told $5. As a plate of drumstick plus rice was $4.30 I asked what else is included. Immediately she said no drumstick, and I said your menu said so. Immediately she printed another receipt for a plate of chicken rice at $3.50. This is the going price for a hawker stall elsewhere. I wondered how much the tourists in front of me paid for the similar looking plate of chicken rice. The cashier obviously know what she was doing. The chicken rice was in clumps, made worst by the thick sauce they pour on the chicken possibly to flavour it. Chicken was not flavourful as they need to poured the thick sauce over it. Good steamed chicken does not need any condiments. Enough said. The old Swee Kee chicken rice wins hands down compared to this.",5.0,"Jun 26, 2016",2016
I thought I would love this since it was very highly publicized as a must try by almost every Vlogger and travel/food channel hosts. I was excited yet skeptical.

"this was an unquestionable requirement visit goal on our Singapore schedule, Michelin featured Hainanese Chicken Rice. I have observed each YouTube video on this dish. Situated in a seller like setting, be set up to perspiration slugs. We chose to go around evening time. Once inside this zone, with slow down after slow down of open kitchen, you will feel the warmth. It's more sizzling than outside. The line is long however it moves quick. Truth be told, I am not used to these conditions. As my child and I snatch a table with outsiders, we hold up with the huge fans above blowing at us with no help. As the dishes are put before me, I can tell how delicious and succulent the dim meat looks. What I didn't exactly expect was the bizarre thick covering everywhere throughout the chicken. I don't know what that is but rather I delve in. It is past delicate and the skin on the chicken was extremely sleek. Once more, I was somewhat pestered by that thick covering. As I take each chomp, it was difficult to eat as the huge fans continued blowing my hair and stalling out against my sweat-soaked face. I needed to ensure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken simultaneously. Shockingly, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this previously. It's still great however nothing unique. With everything taken into account we did delighted in the supper. The strategy where they rapidly poach their chicken works. Had I have eaten it in an a lot cooler condition, I may have made the most of my dinner better. Extremely Nice Experience of the day here..!!!",5.0,"Dec 26, 2017",2017
"As many others that travel to Singapore, Tian Tian is probably on the top of their list of must try restaurants/food stalls.  A local friend recommended Tian Tian (or Ah Tai if the line was too long here) so naturally I knew I would be stopping by.  We had originally planned on stopping by for either lunch or dinner on Monday but after checking their business hours, we noticed they were closed that day.  Seeing how we were leaving on Wednesday morning, we made the trek over to Tian Tian (don't utilize the map location on yelp as it takes you to the wrong place as this is hawker stand is inside the Maxwell food center) for an early dinner.  It was a super muggy/hot evening so we opted to take the food back to the hotel to enjoy in an air conditioned room.  We were lucky to find a short line and were in and out within 5 minutes.  We ended up ordering their half chicken along with two orders of rice and an order of their bean sprouts.  To our surprise, the portions were huge!!!  We only ended up eating 3/4 of the chicken and maybe about 3/4 of the rice.  One draw back about taking the food to go is that they didn't include the ginger oil and also some sweet soy sauce which is what we are accustomed to having along with our Hainan chicken rice.  Though the chicken was super tender, I didn't think the rice was that aromatic or flavorful.  Despite being disappointed with the rice, Tian Tian was 1/4 the cost of our dinner at Chatterbox.  I think the perfect Hainan chicken dinner would be the chicken at Tian Tian and the rice from Chatterbox.Tian Tian is still a must try when visiting Singapore, but I think I'll try other places before coming back again.",1.0,"Nov 28, 2015",2015

Sorry I can't remember the price in USD, but I'm sure it's under $10.I kinda knew what I was going to get into. Fragrant oily rice and soft boiled chicken with skin. Garlic/ginger spicy sauce and dark soy sauce to mix together. What can I say, I'm not a huge fan of boiled room temp. chicken. Now deep fry that bad boy and we talkin' about a real GOOD meal! lol j/k. One persons opinion doesn't really mean much.

It was quickly prepared, very affordable (cheap) and most importantly...delicious! We got the simple ""Chicken Rice"". It comes with fresh cut chicken, atop well cooked rice, with some cucumber slices and a spicy side of sauce (and i do mean spicy!!).

"Amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the Maxwell Road Food Center, one stands out to even the casual observer. It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The ""Vegetable with Oyster Sauce"" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.[A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sell beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian].",5.0,"Sep 2, 2015",2015
"If you choose to come here for their Hainan chicken, be prepared to queue up for a little while! When we visited Maxwell Center, there were numerous Hainan chicken joints inside. But none of them had nearly as long of a line as Tian Tian did! Though it's a typical small sized stall that you'd expect at any hawker centre in Singapore, they've got enough manpower that the division of labor with such little space is impressive! Order after order is rolled out so efficiently that your mouth just waters as the queue gets shorter. If it's 2-3 of you, I highly suggest grabbing half a chicken and 3 rice bowls! Soup is included, along with all the condiments (it's not Hainan chicken without all the sauces)! The chicken is so damn succulent that you'll want to eat it until the very last bit of meat (and veins) that you're nearly close to the bone marrow!If you know some Chinese (or getting a bit rusty), this is your chance to speak it as some of the ladies passing you the food don't know too much English (maybe some Singlish though, haha).

Of course I got the small chicken and rice plate. As someone that grew up eating chicken and rice very frequently as a quick meal my grandmother or father would throw together, I thought it was too overhyped for me.

Not what I'd expect. Thumbs down on the rice for me... The chicken.... hmmm I found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky. I didn't mind it actually.

"LOVE IT. Worth the queue. 11/10 one of the best chicken rice vendors in Singapore, and perhaps the world.The rice is fragrant and fluffy. Not overcooked; you can taste and feel the individual grains as you shove each spoonful into your mouth - no kidding. The steamed chicken is flavourful, tender, and melts in your mouth. The chilli sauce (with ginger) complements both chicken and rice perfectly, adding a tantalising kick to every bite. And you have the option to order some steamed oyster-sauce veggies as a side, if you feel the need to be healthy amidst the amazing hawker fare in Singapore.All-round satisfying dish.

Likely, If I were showing guests around since this restaurant has gained popularity because of Bourdain and that's why people want to try it out. Chicken was moist and flavorful as people say. Rice had good flavor as well. The sauce provided was good but I like the chicken rice meal on its own. $3.50 for a small. If you're with a group, order a whole or half and share. I'd say that other places are just as good without the hype. Also, then you don't have a wait even though this line at Tian Tian moves give or take quickly.

"I was in Singapore for 24 hours (it was an amazing layover). When I was in Singapore, I made it a goal to try Singapore's most famous and iconic dish, Hainanese chicken and rice.

Hainanese chicken and rice is also very popular here and it's the place where I tried it for the first time. It's very delicious and very cheap in Thailand (it costs less than 2 US dollars).With that being said, I was really looking forward to trying it in Singapore, the home of this iconic dish.When I arrived, I was happy and sad to see a line. Happy because it means the food is great and sad because it means I'll have to wait.I eventually got it and I have to say, it's very good!!!

The broth is my favorite part so I was bummed about this!  The sauce was also SUPER FUCKING SPICY.  I like the ginger/garlic sauce more than the spicy red stuff.

I stood in this crazy long line...and it was worth it! I've had hainanese chicken at different places in Singapore and they all pale in comparison to this place. The best.,1.0,"Jul 3, 2018",2018
"Really cheap eat! We had ordered a chicken rice to share! And the only thing we did wrong was not ordered an extra rice to go with it! As I'm not a big meat eater, all I wanted was the rice! The rice was so flavourful! Definitely worth the hype to come here! We were lucky and showed up just before the crowd!Can't wait to come back!",4.0,"Apr 7, 2018",2018
Queue to this place was CRAZY I thought it's going to be awesome. Ended up I got plain tasting chicken with very starchy meh sauce. Rice was good - fragrant but that's about it.,4.0,"Feb 13, 2018",2018
"5 stars for the rice, 1 star for the chicken.  Man that bird is wack, I don't see what people are raving about.  It is so bland and some of my pieces were actually cold to the point I nearly gagged.  The rice is awesome though.  That rice with good chicken would be quite the dish.",4.0,"Aug 23, 2017",2017
"I'm going to say this is the best chicken rice I've ever had. EVER. On a recent trip to Singapore I visited twice in a 36 hour period and now compare every other chicken rice meal to Tian Tian.The lines may be daunting, but they move quickly and the staff here move swiftly to fulfil orders and have you on your way with mounds of steaming rice, silky chicken, perfectly balances chili sauce and broth in moments. Put a member of your group in line while the others hunt down drinks and a table.",5.0,"Dec 22, 2019",2019
"We heard so much about this place, it was hyped up by food bloggers, yelp, trip advisor, Travel Chanel, friends/colleagues, you name it... if you mention Singapore food to anyone.. it's almost a guarantee they will mention this place... so there you go, our expectations were already set high for this place... and so we went around 10:10 am - just when they opened, our cab dropped us of directly at the place, we got inside and noticed immediately the line to queue up, it was not too long.... yet, so we got to the end of it and people were already steadily lining up as well behind me.. a lot.., but the line was moving fast enough anyways so didn't wait that long (maybe 15 minutes top).. we got to ordering up and they were quick and efficient, probably years and years of experience, we both got the chicken rice, sat on our tables and began eating... it was tasty but the chiken was cold, now we don't know if it's supposed to be like this, and if it is then disregard my gripe, but to me it took down the experience of eating the food down several notches.. For the hype this place got.. it was disappointing to us, don't get me wrong it was good, the flavors were there, with a simple but clean presentation... but to me the meal itself lost points when it was cold and not hot.. that's just my honest opinion.. it's true that sometimes rarely a hyped up place lives to its expectations... and I guess to us this was one of those places... but don't let my review discourage you from trying it out, it's sill one of those travel foods you just got to try out yourself.",4.0,"Sep 22, 2017",2017
"Chicken and rice  was good but lady was so mean. Better service and same food few stalls down at ah tai chicken. Over hyped, and more expensive for the same amount of food.",5.0,"Nov 10, 2019",2019
"Review for Nov2016 - Touted as one of the best places for chicken rice, I'd say I was a little disappointed, and unfortunately they also ran out of dark meat. However, was a good first spot for chicken and rice in Singapore.",4.0,"May 29, 2015",2015
"Came here straight after trying the now infamous soya sauce chicken and rice hawker stand and I prefer this one.  I know they are completely different in taste but the wait here is much much shorter (it was also past lunch time when I came) and I think the chicken is equally as tender.  The dish here also isn't swimming in oil like the other place and just had clean simple flavors.  I've been here 2 years ago and it was just as good then as it is now.  Just a word of advice, ask them if you want to get more sauces because they do not like it when you go and  try to serve yourself another dish of it.",4.0,"Jan 17, 2020",2020
"Visited this place for late lunch and had the half chicken with chicken rice. It was very delicious! Probably the best chicken rice I have eaten during my visit. The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty. Because it is in a Hawker Centre, be prepared for the Hawker ambiance. No air condition, crowded, share tables and long queues. But worth it to try the chicken rice!",5.0,"Nov 15, 2019",2019
"I mean, it's a legend for a reason. This was my first chicken and rice experience (but not my last), and I'll remember it fondly.The chicken itself was moist and tender. Not the highest of quality (I feel Heng Ji at Chinatown is higher quality), but not poor by any means. The rice certainly shines, and was delicious. Was here on a Saturday evening and the line wasn't too long. The food centre wasn't too busy either and I got a table no problem.",1.0,"May 30, 2014",2014
"Located inside the Maxwell Food Court, just a short walk from the Chinatown MRT station.  Long line, so the best time to go is before lunch or after the lunch hour crowd.  The line moves very fast and the service very efficient and organized.  The Chicken is very moist, tendet and juicy, the rice fluffy and perfectly seasoned.  The Bean Sprout was cooked just right.  Must definitely try the Tian Tian Chicken  Rice is you are in the area,  or when visiting Singapore.  Simple dish, but so good.  Great to have a good quality meal at a very affordable price.  Highly recommended.",4.0,"Sep 22, 2019",2019
Delicious Hainanese chicken and rice. The menu appears simple but quite delicious. Coming from the US we are used to large portions so you may have to order two plates to get your fill. It comes with ginger sauce and soy sauce for dipping. A must try while you are here!,4.0,"Nov 25, 2019",2019
"I was told that I absolutely had to try this place in Singapore, so my friend and I stopped by the hawker center to give it a try.  Yes, the line is long, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly.  Before you get in line to order, it's good to walk around the hawker center and browse at what other folks are eating.  Look at the plates to identify which stall the food comes from.  This will give you a better understanding about the food options they have - whole chicken, half chicken, single serving with rice, veggies, etc. Since my friend and I were trying lots of different stalls for lunch, we ordered a single serving for each of us.  The chicken is super soft and smooth, definitely not something you can find in the states.  Who can complain about $3.50 for chicken, rice, and soup?",4.0,"May 29, 2017",2017
"Years ago, you could call in advance to order your chicken rice, it would wait for you by the time you reach the (now closed) car park. Forget that now, and be prepared to queue. It's pretty efficient, but still takes anywhere between 10 minutes (at opening at 10am, or mid afternoon) and 45 minutes (meal times). The prices are the highest among all the Hainanese chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (although that's still most reasonable) ; they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request (although that is very much part of the dish!). So, is it worth it? If you're not a foodie, the answer is ""hell, no!"" On the other hand, if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken, the fragrance of the rice, or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce, or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (Tian Tian, Ah Tai, Heng Heng), you would have to say ""this is the best lah!""",5.0,"Feb 8, 2017",2017
"I was all about chicken rice @ Tian Tian the entire time I was in Singapore. When I finally had the chance to try it out, it just turned out to be A-OK. The chicken was fine but the rice was a bit hard -- one notch away from the uncooked categorization. I ended up getting chicken rice three stalls down at Ah Tai, which I liked so much better. It was what I thought the experience would have been like.And oh, maybe it's just me ... but I thought it was weird being forced to stare at Anthony Bourdain's picture while I was standing in line. The hype train is strong.",4.0,"Dec 28, 2017",2017
"This has probably the best white(breast) chicken meat anywhere in Singapore. Moist, succulent and tasty. Usually I would only go for dark meats but here, no issue. Also, if you are not squeamish, they have the most tender gizzards E.V.E.R",5.0,"Dec 22, 2014",2014
"Tian Tian's chicken rice lives up to the reputation. Cold tender, if not a tad gelatinous, chicken is a little challenging for my western pallet, but I dig it. The rice is worthy of a dish on its own. However, everything on the dish is ancillary to the chili sauce. Whatever you do, ask for more chili sauce.",4.0,"Apr 24, 2015",2015
